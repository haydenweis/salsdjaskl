        <h1>Mission</h1>
            <a href="index.html">Net Ware</a>
            <p>NetWare is aiming to provide Roblox exploiters with a elegant and clean Filter Enabled Command Line that can toggle most up to date and latest FE scripts. We are unlike any other FE hub, as we will soon have many features to improve NetWare's user experience. As of today, 31-10-2020 NetWare is in its first announcement stage and getting ready for Planning Stage. NetWare is hoping to get any talented Roblox Exploitation developers to Help Plan, Develop, and release this project. I, the founder am currently the only staff in this project and need as much help to make it successful. 31-10-2020</p>
